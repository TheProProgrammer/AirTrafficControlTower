# AirTrafficControlTower
A console-based simulation of an Air Traffic Control Tower coded in C++ implementing data structures and Algorithms.
The system allows for runway management, flight management, and airport management tasks. Developed as a semester project for the CSC211-Data Structures and Algorithms Course at COMSATS University Islamabad.
## Salient Features
- Runway management for handling landing and takeoff operations.
- Flight management for generating flight plans and managing pending requests.
- Airport management for controlling the status of the airport and other airports.
- Airport status board for displaying the current status of the airport and pending flights.
- Prioritization of flights based on different categories (normal, government/diplomatic, medical emergency).
- Integration of Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating shortest flight routes.
- Support for multiple airport codes and distances between airports.
- User-friendly interface with menu-based navigation.
- Robust error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.
- Efficient use of priority queues for managing landing and takeoff requests.
- Flexibility to add new airports and update airport distances easily.
## Algorithms Used
- Dijkstra's algorithm: Used for finding the shortest flight routes between airports.
- Priority Queue: Used for managing landing and takeoff requests based on priority.
